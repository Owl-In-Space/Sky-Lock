# Sky-Lock

The mobile game is made in the genre of a first-person rail shooter with Tower Defense elements. The goal of the game is to destroy as many flying things as possible (currently only a helicopter) flying over the player before they reach the "capital". To do this, you need to point the sight at the target, wait for the missile to aim and fire. Further, the missile itself must destroy the target. The screenshots show only the work of the main mechanics of the game.
